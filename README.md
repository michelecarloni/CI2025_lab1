<h2>PROJECT STRUCTURE</h2>

Several algorithms have been implemented and tested on the knapsack problem, with the following order:
- hill climbing
- simulated annealing
- iterated local search
- guided hill climbing

During the resolution there were some issues to overcome, so the file **knapsack.ipynb** contains all the explenation and the thought process from the first algorithm tested to the very last one (which is the one that works for all the 3 problems).
The file **final_solution.ipynb** instead, only runs the best algorithm over the 3 problems.

So if you want to go straight to the working solution, run the code on the file **final_solution.ipynb**, otherwise if you are interested in all the experimentations done and some explenation, check out **knapsack.ipynb**.
