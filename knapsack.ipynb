    "- GOAL: maximizing the value and minimizing the weight of objects carried by the <NUM_KNAPSACKS> knapsacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should respect the contraints on the weight, which defines how much weights a knapsack can carry.\n",

    "Ex. [x, y, z] -> 3 constraints on backpack 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution is represented by a 2D matrix (NUM_KNAPSACKS, NUM_ITEMS). Each row represents a knapsack and for each row we have a list of carried items where its length = NUM_ITEMS. Each element of the list is either a 1 if the knapsack carries the item, or is 0 if it doesn't carry the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the fitness of the function is defined by overall value carried by all the knapsacks combined (sum of single total value of each knapsack)"
