    "\n",
    "- We should respect the contraints on the weight, which defines how much weights a knapsack can carry.\n",

    "- The solution is represented by a 2D matrix (NUM_KNAPSACKS, NUM_ITEMS). Each row represents a knapsack and for each row we have a list of carried items where its length = NUM_ITEMS. Each element of the list is either a 1 if the knapsack carries the item, or is 0 if it doesn't carry the item.\n",
